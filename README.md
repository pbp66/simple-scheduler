To use the scheduler, enter the details of an event, appointment, task, etc at the time it occurs. Click the save button in the right hand column to save the event. Upon saving, a notification will appear above the schedule notifying you that the event was successfully saved to local storage along with stating the time and event details.

The event will be saved until it is updated or the browser's local storage is cleared.
